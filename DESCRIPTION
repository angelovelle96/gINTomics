Description: gINTomics is an R package for Multi-Omics data integration and 
            visualization. gINTomics is designed to detect the association 
            between the expression of a target and of its regulators, taking 
            into account also their genomics modifications such as Copy Number 
            Variations (CNV) and methylation.
