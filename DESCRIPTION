Description: gINTomics is an R package for Multi-Omics data integration and 
            visualization.
            gINTomics is designed to detect the associationbetween the 
            expression of a target and of its regulators, taking into account 
            also their genomics modifications such as Copy Number Variations 
            (CNV) and methylation. 
            What is more, gINTomics allows integration results visualizations 
            via a Shiny-based interactive app.
